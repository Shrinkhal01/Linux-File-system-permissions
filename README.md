# Input Converter

This project is a simple web application that converts a 9-character permission string (e.g., `rwxr-xr--`) into its octal representation (e.g., `755`). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Input a 9-character permission string.
- Convert the permission string to its octal representation.
- Display the octal value on the web page.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [(https://github.com/Shrinkhal01/Linux-File-system-permissions.git)]
   ````
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cherrypy
```
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser.(Since all has been integrated into the html file so now there was no need of a seperate python file)
4. Enter a 9-character permission string in the input field.
5. Click the "Convert" button.

   ```
    The octal value will be displayed below the input field.
   ```
